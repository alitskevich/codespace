Even if the outcome is ultimately fine, it means I’ve left a team member unsupported at some point. A somewhat recent example would be this training we do every year for new project managers. Because it’s an event that my team has run so many times, I didn’t think to check in and had no idea a scheduling conflict was brewing into a full-on turf war with another team. The resolution actually ended up being a quick and easy conversation at the leadership team meeting, but had I just asked about it sooner it would never have been a problem to begin with.

By following these principles, developers can create code that is easier to understand, modify, and extend.\n\nThe principles to be followed when designing software include:\n\n1. High cohesion/loose coupling: This principle states that components within a system should be highly cohesive, meaning that they should have a clear and specific purpose. At the same time, these components should be loosely coupled, meaning that they should be independent of each other and interact through well-defined interfaces.\n\n2. SOLID: This acronym stands for five design principles - Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion. These principles help developers create code that is modular, flexible, and easy to maintain.\n\n3. Separate concerns: This principle states that different aspects of a system, such as user interface, business logic, and data access, should be separated into distinct modules or layers. This helps to improve code readability, maintainability, and reusability.\n\n4. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): This principle emphasizes the importance of avoiding code duplication. By following this principle, developers can reduce the risk of errors, improve code maintainability, and make it easier to update and extend the codebase.\n\n5. KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): This principle advocates for simplicity in design. It suggests that software systems should be kept as simple as possible, avoiding unnecessary complexity. This helps to improve code readability, maintainability, and scalability.\n\nKey points to remember when considering design principles include the importance of creating modular, flexible, and maintainable code, avoiding code duplication, and keeping designs simple and focused.

I made sure to acknowledge his concern. And then rather than pointing out that he himself had voted for the entire staff to undergo this training, I focused on his direct objection and explained how the training was meant to improve not just the culture of the company, but also the efficiency at which we operated—and that the goal was for the training to make everyone’s workload feel lighter.

    "explain": "The main reason for the difference between a delete statement and a truncate statement in databases is the level of specificity and the ability to rollback the operation. \n\nPrinciples to be followed when understanding this difference include:\n1. Delete statement removes specific rows based on a condition specified in the query.\n2. Truncate statement removes all rows from a table without any condition.\n3. Delete statement can be rolled back using a transaction, while truncate statement cannot be undone.\n\nKey points to remember:\n1. Delete statement is more targeted and allows for selective removal of rows.\n2. Truncate statement is faster as it removes all rows at once, but it is a non-recoverable operation.\n3. Delete statement is commonly used when specific rows need to be removed, while truncate statement is used when all data in a table needs to be cleared."
