# Arrmatura

> ![](assets/logo.svg)

`Arrmatura` is an universal framework, which promotes ideas of declarative functional programming.

It comprises of

- formal notation to define components and its composition.
- Typescript runtime, enabling development of applications of any kind.
- Implementation for web clients.
- UI kit with plenty of web components, services, forms, editors etc.

The framework is designed to facilitate the creation of applications
by allowing developers to define components and specify how they are composed and connected.

This component composition is achieved through a declarative syntax,
which describes how data flows between components and how it is propagated across the composition.

This streamlines the development process and makes it easier for developers
to create complex and dynamic applications that can respond to changes in data in real-time.

Overall, the framework aims to provide a flexible and intuitive way
to build web applications that are scalable, maintainable, and responsive.
