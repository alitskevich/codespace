# Arrmatura

## Definitive

`Arrmatura` is a framework which inherits declarative approach and functional programming.

It comprises of

- extended HTML notation to define components, its composition, behaviour and data flow.
- type system and runtime enabling development of applications of any kind.
- `IPlatform` implementation for web client applications.
- Web UI kits with plenty of components, services, forms, editors etc.

## Key features and benefits of the platform

The framework is designed to facilitate the creation of web applications
by allowing developers to define components and specify how they are composed and connected.

This component composition is achieved through a declarative syntax,
which describes how data flows between components and how it is propagated across the composition.

This streamlines the development process and makes it easier for developers
to create complex and dynamic applications that can respond to changes in data in real-time.

Overall, the framework aims to provide a flexible and intuitive way
to build web applications that are scalable, maintainable, and responsive.
