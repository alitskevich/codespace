|                     `Program` | A formal prescription given to a runtime to process (to apply trasformation rules in some order) incoming data.                                                                                                |
|                        `Type` | A specification that defines the possible values that can be reffered by a variable.                                                                                                                           |
|                    `Variable` | A program entity, which may reffer some data value.                                                                                                                                                            |
| `Object-oriented programming` | A programming style that evolves around composing components, which interact with each others by handling streams of events.                                                                                   |
|                   `Component` | An individual runtime entity that has a lifecycle, state, and behavior. Components can interact with others and are treated as black boxes.                                                                    |
|                       `Class` | A design-time specification for the state and behavior of a component. It provides guidance for the runtime to create and manage instances of the component.                                                   |
|                       `State` | A private data structure that is managed by a component.                                                                                                                                                       |
|                    `Property` | A public getter/setter pair that allows access to a state value by a specified key.                                                                                                                            |
|                    `Behavior` | A specification that defines how a component should change its state in response to external impacts.                                                                                                          |
|                   `Interface` | A design-time specification of the methods and signatures that can be used to interact with a component.                                                                                                       |
|                 `Composition` | The                                                                                                                                                                                                            | parent-child and context-content relationships between components. It defines the scope and lifecycle of the components that they can interact with. |
|                    `Template` | A text written in a formal language that allows for the description of component composition and property binding in a declarative way, focused on the desired outcome rather than the implementation details. |
|            `Property binding` | A formal sentence that expresses a dependency between the value of a target component's property and other properties. It ensures that the target property is updated whenever the dependency changes.         |
|        `Property propagation` | A one-way binding that passes property values from a container component to its contents.                                                                                                                      |
|                        `Hook` | A component-bound method that is called by the runtime at specific points in the component's lifecycle.                                                                                                        |
